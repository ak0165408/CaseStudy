		<p>
			Greetings All! My name is Adam Kincheloe. I am 37 years old. I am originally from Lebanon, MO. I currently reside here in Springfield, MO. I have been in school most of my life. After graduating from high school, I went and received my Bachelors of Science in Education degree in Chemistry Education with a minor in C.I.S. from then Southwest Missouri State University (now <a href = "http://www.missouristate.edu">Missouri State University</a>) in 2003. I went on to teach high school science and also went to <a href = "http://www.drury.edu">Drury University</a> earning my Masters in Education in Secondary Education in 2005. After some time I left the education world and entered the I.T. world. I currently work at <a href = "http://www.goldmtn.com">Gold Mountain Communications</a> where I am the systems administrator. While at Gold Mountain I decided to go back to school and just recently graduated in December 2016 from <a href = "http://www.otc.edu">OTC</a> obtaining my A.A.S in Networking Technology. During this program I also obtained 3 I.T. industry certifications, including <a href = "https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/a">CompTIA A+</a>, <a href = "https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/network">CompTIA Network+</a>, and <a href = "http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna-routing-switching.html">Cisco CCNA</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			So why am I in this class? Three reasons:
		</p>
			<ol>
				<li>I decided to obtain the two CIS Certificates of Specialization, Computer Programming and Web Development.</li>
				<li>I want to learn JavaScript.</li>
				<li>I hope to learn new skills and apply them in my professional career.</li>
			</ol>
